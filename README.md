* Slightly larger planets (+2 pop on all planet-types)
* Buffed all ships (incl. pirates+monsters) with space and hp with a fixed +25% for a bit 
* Most new buildings are pretty expensive to maintain - been added as a money sink.

# Why create this mod?
Mod I started some years ago - spent a lot of time searching for again and decided just add here so I won't loose it again.

Wanted to have a much longer playing experience using Very Slow -- it still feels way too fast.

Feels like it is a race to money and then everything is dictated on that; trying to insert moneysinks into the game.

## Note
Works best on Very Slow or slower pacing for having time to utilizing any of the new tech.
